When I was at school in the early 2000s, the internet was a very different place. Bizarre dotcom ideas were exploding everywhere, online shopping was taking over, and digital entrepreneur's moneymaking creativity was unbounded. One outcome of this that I strongly remember being covered in mainstream news back in 2005 was [Alex Tew](https://twitter.com/tewy)'s Million Dollar Homepage.

## What was the Million Dollar Homepage?

Tew's concept was simple: A page with 1,000,000 pixels, $1 each, anyone can purchase blocks of them for advertising, and once they're gone they're gone.

This basic idea, simple execution, and astonishing success truly embodied the "novel idea makes thousands overnight" vibe a lot of the early internet had. There was no reason for the website to be of any value to advertisers besides the fact... it was there. There was no product, no investors, no corporate backing, just 1,000,000 pixels of unused advertising space. 

Of course, this was back when online adverts were a beautiful wild west, with gambling, dating, free software (or malware) and illegal video downloads were all fair game. The end result is a beautiful montage of mid-2000s internet, preserved in a 1000 x 1000 pixel bubble. Whilst I'd recommending visiting [the eye burning original](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/) for a pixel-perfect version, here's a smaller version (click to view full size):

So how on earth did this ~~monstrosity~~ masterpiece happen?

## Why did it happen?

Alex Tew was a student looking to make a bit of cash to pay for his university degree, understandably wanting to break the "broke student" stereotype. The idea's origin story listed in the (currently broken) FAQ[^broken-faq] describes the situation in Alex Tew's own words:

> It was a muggy summer's night late in August (2005), the time around midnight, and there I was, lying on my bed with a notepad, brainstorming ideas to make money for uni. I think I'm quite a creative person, so I wanted to come up with an idea that was unique and would hopefully capture people's imagination, but with the whole purpose of making money. No point being shy about it! I think we brits can sometimes be too shy about money. Well bugger that, I DO NOT want to be a broke student!
>
> So anyway, after an hour of two of jotting random things on paper, the idea seemingly popped out of nowhere. Almost like my subconscious mind had been ticking over in the background, working it all out. So it just kind of happened. That's about it. I scribbled it down and within about 10 minutes a picture of what needed to be done had emerged.

### Overview 

In total the 1,000,000 pixels have 3,306 different adverts. Many of these are by the same websites or companies, but this is the number defined on the page.

Out of these, 143 were "pending", "reserved", or otherwise never valid URLs for one reason or another. This leaves us with 3,163 valid adverts. However, some of these are for the same domains (e.g. myspace), so we end up with 2,804 unique domains that our adverts point to.

Out of these 2,804 domains, 550 completely fail to respond or don't exist, 29 give server errors, and 531 give other errors, usually that the content is forbidden or can't be found. 

**In conclusion, 1,694 of the 2,804 advert domains are still alive and responding properly!**.

### Detailed results

| Result | Count | Response Code Breakdown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2XX Success | 1694 (60.4%) | 200 OK: 1682<br>204 No Content: 12 |
| 4XX Client Error | 531 (19.0%) | 400 Bad Request: 9<br>401 Unauthorized: 1<br>403 Forbidden: 203<br>404 Not Found: 158<br>405 Method Not Allowed: 88<br>406 Not Acceptable: 63<br>409 Conflict: 1<br>410 Gone: 1<br>412 Precondition Failed: 5<br>429 Too Many Requests: 2 |
| 5XX Server Error | 29 (1.0%) | 500 Internal Server Error: 12<br>501 Not Implemented: 1<br>502 Bad Gateway: 2<br>503 Service Unavailable: 11<br>521: 1<br>530: 1<br>999: 1 |
| Timed out / unreachable | 550 (19.6%) | |

### HTTPS

Interestingly, only 8 of these domains are HTTPS addresses on the site, whereas now almost all sites use it by default. 

I had a theory that many of the errors above might be due to HTTPS redirects not working properly. To test this, I changed the list of 2,804 domains to all use HTTPS by default, and ran my checker again. 

I was wrong however, and the 2,257 / 2,804 domains that could at least be connected to enough to throw an error dropped to a rather awful 1,498 / 2,804. Further investigation showed that this was likely due to my tool using an outdated HTTPS (technically SSL) protocol however, with the failed sites consisting of a mixture of very outdated (doesn't support HTTPS) to very up to date (only supports modern HTTPS).

## What colours are used?

When looking at the image, your eyes are drawn to... all of it at once. However, certain colours "pop" more, such as the neon pink, green, or yellows. A logical question is... which colours are most used, and does this match how our eyes see the image?

Here's the top 10 colours used:

| Colour | Hex code | # of pixels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <span style="background-color:#010101">#1</span> | #010101 | 146147 |
| <span style="background-color:#ffffff">#2</span> | #ffffff | 144104 |
| <span style="background-color:#ff0000">#3</span> | #ff0000 | 45829 |
| <span style="background-color:#fefd00">#4</span> | #fefd00 | 37516 |
| <span style="background-color:#05ff05">#5</span> | #05ff05 | 26514 |
| <span style="background-color:#1700ff">#6</span> | #1700ff | 23572 |
| <span style="background-color:#ff07fb">#7</span> | #ff07fb | 16545 |
| <span style="background-color:#e7e6e8">#8</span> | #e7e6e8 | 15473 |
| <span style="background-color:#251026">#9</span> | #251026 | 10657 |
| <span style="background-color:#d8d8d9">#10</span> | #d8d8d9 | 9894 |

As expected, the neon colours are the most widely used, in addition to the greyscale black / white colours.

Interestingly though, despite red, yellow, green being the top 3, looking at the image green pixels seem much more visible. This may be because green pixels tend to be part of larger advertisements, whilst yellow pixels are usually smaller adverts trying to be noticed.

## What is Million Dollar Homepage's legacy?

As with any simple idea that makes $1m in a few months, there were thousands of copycats! Most of these got negligible attention, and without the media attention quickly shut down.

Perhaps more surprisingly, elements of this "canvas of pixels" idea can be seen alive today in concepts like Reddit's r/place. Besides the general "individuals placing pixels, that form something greater than its parts" concept though, the differences are far more numerous than the similarities. r/place is free, pixels can be overwritten, and battles over areas of it are expected.

For evidence of their similarity, compare the Million Dollar Homepage's final canvas to the 2017 and 2022 r/place results (click to view fullsize):

Perhaps even more impressively given how quickly events and websites can fade into obscurity on the internet, Tew's Million Dollar Homepage is still referenced pretty regularly today, usually as a motivational "your idea can go big too!" example. Considering it still lives in mine and others[^rent-free] heads 17 years later, it's hard to understate the effect this relatively small idea has had on countless online creators over the years.

## Where is the creator now?

Even more impressive than Alex Tew's first $1m business idea was his ability to eventually spin this online clout and creativity into the meditation-focused startup Calm.com in 2013, now a unicorn (valuation >$1bn)[^unicorn-startup]. 

For a more detailed story of his journey from Million Dollar Homepage to co-founder of a billion dollar company, I recommend [The Hustle's biopiece](https://thehustle.co/million-dollar-homepage-alex-tew/).

    var keyNumbers = key.substring(
        key.indexOf("(") + 1, 
        key.lastIndexOf(")")
    )
    var keyRGB = keyNumbers.split(", ", 3)
    var keyHex = "#" + ((1 << 24) + (parseInt(keyRGB[0]) << 16) + (parseInt(keyRGB[1]) << 8) + parseInt(keyRGB[2])).toString(16).slice(1);
    newArray[keyHex] = colorCounts[key]
}); 
var sortedArray = Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(newArray).sort( (a,b) => b[1] - a[1] )    
);
console.log(sortedArray)
