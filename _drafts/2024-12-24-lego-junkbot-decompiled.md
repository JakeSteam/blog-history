## About Junkbot

### Who created Junkbot?

Junkbot was created by "gameLab", a company founded in early 2001 by Eric Zimmerman and Peter Lee "simply because we wanted to make games"[^vice]. They quickly found work creating web games for LEGO.com due to their connections made whilst working on the extremely popular Sissyfight 2000. gameLab's story has been told in detail elsewhere (e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelab)), with a LEGO podcast episode centred around Junkbot[^lego-podcast] ([transcript](https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/blte95c26554f38a01a/bits_n_bricks_s03e29_feature_and_transcript.pdf)).

These names are mostly taken from gameLab's website in October 2001[^gamelab-people] and are all included in Junkbot's August 9th press release[^junkbot-release-date]. I've included their bios verbatim, plus added information on their work in the last 20 years when appropriate. It's worth noting the extraordinarily high levels of continued collaboration even decades later, and how most continued to publicly talk about games and educate others.

#### Eric Zimmerman (Founder & CEO)

> Eric Zimmerman just can't stop making games. After a childhood of roping friends and family into playtesting his game experiments, Eric has spent the last eight years in the game industry. Before founding gameLab with Peter Lee, Eric collaborated with Word.com on the underground online hit, SiSSYFiGHT 2000 (www.sissyfight.com). Other titles include the PC CD-ROM titles Gearheads (Philips Media, 1996) and The Robot Club (Southpeak Interactive, 1998). An unapologetic part-time academic, Eric has taught game design at MIT, NYU, and Parsons School of Design and he is the Director of RE:PLAY, a series of events examining game design and game culture. He is currently working on two books about game design and game culture, to be published in 2002 by MIT Press and Eyebeam Atelier. Eric has exhibited non-computer game projects at galleries and museums in the US and abroad.

Zimmerman has continued creating / writing about / speaking about games _relentlessly_ since Junkbot, with additional focuses on play and design both inside and outside of academia. He is on Twitter/X as [@zimmermaneric](https://twitter.com/zimmermaneric), and has links to much of his content on [ericzimmerman.com](https://www.ericzimmerman.com/) (e.g. Junkbot!).

#### Peter Lee (Founder & President)

> Peter is a digital media renaissance man, equally skilled in visual design, game design, and game programming. Peter began his career as a designer for TIME online, where he designed the award-winning web content feature "Last call: Face of Alcoholism." He has held a number of positions since then, including Director of Technology at Churchill Communications, a New Jersey-based Medical Communication Company. where he managed web and CD-ROM projects and lead IT research and technical development. Peter also helped found the Game division at Funny Garbage, developing several online games for the Cartoon Network website. He currently holds an Adjunct Professorship at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program, where he teaches Game Development.

Lee (no relation) has continued contributing to games (often with Zimmerman) since his time at gameLab, including "Additional Thanks" in 2013's Rogue Legacy[^peter-lee-thanks]. He has since helped start gaming festivals and nonprofit schools[^lee-schools], a Korean "big game" (e.g. immersive experience) design studio Nolgong[^nolgong], and speaks at events worldwide (e.g. Germany[^lee-germany], Hong Kong[^lee-hong-kong]).

#### Frank Latz (Director of Game Design)

> Before joining gameLab, Frank was Creative Director of the New York design firm R/GA Interactive, where he worked on a wide variety of game projects including the PC games Gearheads and The Robot Club, as well as multiple online and site-based games for such clients as Microsoft, Sony, The Discovery Channel, NASDAQ, and Children's Television Workshop. Frank is a member of the faculty of NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, where he teaches classes in game design and interactive narrative. His writing on games, technology and culture has appeared in a variety of publications. Frank is also the co-designer of several massively multiplayer real-world conference games including Quorum for the Re:Play Conference, MANIFESTO for AIGA's Collison conference, and LiNK for Flashforward 2000.

Lantz (along with plenty of other former gameLab employees) teaches at NYU Game Center[^lantz-interview], and continues to create games. This includes. Many of his talks, papers, and games (e.g. Junkbot!) are available on [franklantz.net](https://www.franklantz.net/).

Unbelievably, I've spent many hours with & completed one of Lantz's recent games (2017): [Universal Paperclips](https://decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)[^lantz-paperclips]. This is one of the most popular incremental / clicker games of all time, with a detailed Wikipedia article[^paperclips-wiki] and "In the first 11 days, 450,000 people played the game, most to completion"[^paperclips-wired]. It is based on the "[paperclip maximizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer)" AI thought experiment, even more relevant today with the relentless pace of AI innovation.

#### Naomi Clark (LEGO Game Specialist)

Whilst not part of gameLab, Naomi (who also teaches at NYU Game Center[^naomi-nyu]) was producer of Junkbot for LEGO.com[^naomi-tweet]. This period is summarised in the LEGO podcast "Bits n Bricks" S3E29[^lego-podcast] ([transcript](https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/blte95c26554f38a01a/bits_n_bricks_s03e29_feature_and_transcript.pdf)):

> That connection between Clark, Zimmerman and the rest of the Gamelab crew would eventually lead to a lasting relationship between Gamelab and the LEGO Group, with the studio creating a dozen games for the website. But the first was, perhaps, the most memorable: Junkbot.
> When Clark approached Gamelab about making a game, the studio came up with a twopart pitch document that explored the play values of the LEGO Group and offered up a number of ideas.
