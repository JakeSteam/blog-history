## About Junkbot

### Who created Junkbot?

Junkbot was created by "gameLab", a company of 6 founded in early 2001 by Eric Zimmerman and Peter Lee "simply because we wanted to make games"[^vice]. They quickly found work creating web games for LEGO.com due to their connections made whilst working on the extremely popular Sissyfight 2000[^sissyfight]. gameLab's story has been told in detail elsewhere (e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelab)), with a LEGO podcast episode centred around Junkbot[^lego-podcast] ([transcript](https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/blte95c26554f38a01a/bits_n_bricks_s03e29_feature_and_transcript.pdf)).

These names are mostly taken from gameLab's website in October 2001[^gamelab-people] and are all included in Junkbot's August 9th press release[^junkbot-release-date]. I've included their bios verbatim, plus added information on their work in the last 20 years when appropriate. It's worth noting the extraordinarily high levels of continued collaboration even decades later, and how most continued to publicly talk about games and educate others.

#### Eric Zimmerman (Founder & CEO)

> Eric Zimmerman just can't stop making games. After a childhood of roping friends and family into playtesting his game experiments, Eric has spent the last eight years in the game industry. Before founding gameLab with Peter Lee, Eric collaborated with Word.com on the underground online hit, SiSSYFiGHT 2000 (www.sissyfight.com). Other titles include the PC CD-ROM titles Gearheads (Philips Media, 1996) and The Robot Club (Southpeak Interactive, 1998). An unapologetic part-time academic, Eric has taught game design at MIT, NYU, and Parsons School of Design and he is the Director of RE:PLAY, a series of events examining game design and game culture. He is currently working on two books about game design and game culture, to be published in 2002 by MIT Press and Eyebeam Atelier. Eric has exhibited non-computer game projects at galleries and museums in the US and abroad.

Zimmerman has continued creating / writing about / speaking about games _relentlessly_ since Junkbot, with additional focuses on play and design both inside and outside of academia. He is on Twitter/X as [@zimmermaneric](https://twitter.com/zimmermaneric), and has links to much of his content on [ericzimmerman.com](https://www.ericzimmerman.com/) (e.g. Junkbot!).

#### Peter Lee (Founder & President)

> Peter is a digital media renaissance man, equally skilled in visual design, game design, and game programming. Peter began his career as a designer for TIME online, where he designed the award-winning web content feature "Last call: Face of Alcoholism." He has held a number of positions since then, including Director of Technology at Churchill Communications, a New Jersey-based Medical Communication Company. where he managed web and CD-ROM projects and lead IT research and technical development. Peter also helped found the Game division at Funny Garbage, developing several online games for the Cartoon Network website. He currently holds an Adjunct Professorship at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program, where he teaches Game Development.

Lee (no relation) has continued contributing to games (often with Zimmerman) since his time at gameLab, including "Additional Thanks" in 2013's Rogue Legacy[^peter-lee-thanks]. He has since helped start gaming festivals and nonprofit schools[^lee-schools], a Korean "big game" (e.g. immersive experience) design studio Nolgong[^nolgong], and speaks at events worldwide (e.g. Germany[^lee-germany], Hong Kong[^lee-hong-kong]).

#### Frank Latz (Director of Game Design)

> Before joining gameLab, Frank was Creative Director of the New York design firm R/GA Interactive, where he worked on a wide variety of game projects including the PC games Gearheads and The Robot Club, as well as multiple online and site-based games for such clients as Microsoft, Sony, The Discovery Channel, NASDAQ, and Children's Television Workshop. Frank is a member of the faculty of NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, where he teaches classes in game design and interactive narrative. His writing on games, technology and culture has appeared in a variety of publications. Frank is also the co-designer of several massively multiplayer real-world conference games including Quorum for the Re:Play Conference, MANIFESTO for AIGA's Collison conference, and LiNK for Flashforward 2000.

Lantz (along with plenty of other former gameLab employees) teaches at NYU Game Center[^lantz-interview], and continues to create games. This includes. Many of his talks, papers, and games (e.g. Junkbot!) are available on [franklantz.net](https://www.franklantz.net/).

Unbelievably, I've spent many hours with one of Lantz's recent games (2017): [Universal Paperclips](https://decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)[^lantz-paperclips]. This is one of the most popular incremental / clicker games of all time, with a detailed Wikipedia article[^paperclips-wiki] and "In the first 11 days, 450,000 people played the game, most to completion"[^paperclips-wired]. It is based on the "[paperclip maximizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer)" AI thought experiment, even more relevant today with the relentless pace of AI innovation.

#### Ranjit Bhatnagar (Director of R&D)

> Ranjit has been involved with digital art on the Internet before the Web ever existed: he helped found sito.org, a pre-WWW collaborative arts community. For the last several years, Ranjit has been on the board of SCAN, an old-school annual digital arts conference dating back to 1979 . Ranjit was a member of the original design and implementation team for the Philadelphia InquirerÂ¹s website. Later, he worked as the Director of Technology at Word Magazine, where he led the technical development of the art toy Pixeltime (pixeltime.com) and the award-winning multiplayer game Sissyfight (www.sissyfight.com). Unsatisfied merely making games for a living, in his spare time Ranjit creates alternative musical instruments, such as the Silence Organ and the MIDI Ironing Board. His art and installations have appeared in solo and group exhibitions in California and Pennsylvania. Personal site: www.moonmilk.com.

#### Peter Nicolai (Game Programmer)

> Peter Nicolai graduated in 2001 from NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. There, he attended game design and programming classes taught by gameLab staff members Eric Zimmerman, Frank Lantz and Peter Lee, in which he was the subject of many strange experiments that he does not remember. He now works at gameLab. Past experience: Peter used to play accordion in a rock/cabaret band. He was a production assistant on the TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000. Other things he has done for a living include toy-store display construction, grading elementary-school reading tests and painting ceramic fish. Outside of gameLab, he is involved in various game, music and video projects.

#### Nicholas Fortugno (Game Designer)

> Nick was inducted into role-playing life at the age of five, and has been an avid consumer and producer of role-playing, live-action, and game culture ever since. Nick's bizarre sense of interactive aesthetics have led him to design a number of role-playing universes and narrative games; most notably, he founded and ran the Seasons of Darkness group, a 5 1/2 year live action project which was featured on Showtime. Nick's work on Seasons introduced him to Eric Zimmerman, and that introduction eventually brought him to gameLab. Nick also holds a Adjunct Teaching position at Bronx Community College, where he teaches developmental and compositional English, and is currently pursuing graduate study at Hunter College. In his spare time, Nick studies classical guitar, apprentices in T'ai Chi, and subjects more hapless players to his role-playing/art experiments.

#### Michael Sweet (Music & Sound Design)

> Award winning composer and sound designer, Michael Sweet is a frequent collaborator with gameLab and his work can be heard in many of their games, including Shockwave's audio award winning BliX. Michael is the Creative Director of his own Silicon Alley music and sound design house Blister Media. After graduating from highly regarded Berklee College of Music, Michael's digital artistry led him to specialize in creating interactive scores for cutting edge new media projects. Credits include: the ground breaking multiplayer game Netwits for MSN, Shockwave's Loop, award-winning kiosks for the Discovery Network stores, and Sesame Workshop's Passport Kids. In broadcast, Michael's work can also be heard in many commercials and network identities, including HBO-Zone, CNN, General Motors, Kodak, and AT&T. Working with other digital artists, Michael sound sculptures have been exhibited at museums in London, Florence, Amsterdam, Toronto, and New York, and Hong Kong. Web site: www.blistermedia.com

#### Naomi Clark (LEGO Web & Digital Producer)

Whilst not part of gameLab, Naomi (who also teaches at NYU Game Center[^naomi-nyu]) was producer of Junkbot for LEGO.com[^naomi-tweet]. This period is summarised in the LEGO podcast "Bits n Bricks" S3E29[^lego-podcast] ([transcript](https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/blte95c26554f38a01a/bits_n_bricks_s03e29_feature_and_transcript.pdf)):

> That connection between Clark, Zimmerman and the rest of the Gamelab crew would eventually lead to a lasting relationship between Gamelab and the LEGO Group, with the studio creating a dozen games for the website. But the first was, perhaps, the most memorable: Junkbot.
> When Clark approached Gamelab about making a game, the studio came up with a twopart pitch document that explored the play values of the LEGO Group and offered up a number of ideas.

She later ended up working at gameLab (and many other studios) as a Game Designer, and can be found on Twitter/X as [@metasynthie](https://twitter.com/metasynthie).

## Junkbot's legacy

Despite Junkbot's relative obscure status as a cult classic over the last 20 years, it is by no means forgotten. As well as the occasional fan content or nostalgic Reddit post, there are even subtle references in official LEGO products.

### Unofficial LEGO builds

With the LEGO fanbase making unofficial sets of almost everything on Earth, it's perhaps not too surprising that Junkbot has had plenty of MOCs (My Own Creations) created over the years.

Of special note is [JK Brickworks](https://jkbrickworks.com/junkbot/)' 8:1 scale model from 2003, and jxu's [improved 2020 version](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-50835/jxu/junkbot/#details) with instructions:

|                                      JK Brickworks[^2003-moc]                                       |                                           jxu[^2020-moc]                                            |

[^2020-moc]: <https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-50835/jxu/junkbot/#details>

In addition to builds of Junkbot itself, there's been all kinds of related content:

- A [Junkbot themed LEGO pirate ship](https://www.flickr.com/photos/100403937@N04/albums/72177720301763243/with/52325861091).
- An [ode to Junkbot](https://mackerelphones.com/2020/11/03/i-love-trash-an-ode-to-junkbot-the-lego-flash-game-legend/), that ends up asking surprisingly intriguing questions about the world of Junkbot!
- A [rip of the game's funky soundtrack](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/junkbot-online-gamerip-2002).
- MOCs of [the game's enemies](https://board.ttvchannel.com/t/junkbot-mini-mocs/26186).

### Official LEGO easter eggs

Junkbot clearly has fans within LEGO too, since he continues to pop up in odd little places now and then. These two sets are explicitly mentioned in a "Bits N' Bricks" podcast, there may be others out there!

> The little bot Junkbot, or references to it, have popped up in a Ninjago theme set and the Haunted House set as well[^podcast-transcript]

[^podcast-transcript]: <https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/set/assets/blte95c26554f38a01a/bits_n_bricks_s03e29_feature_and_transcript.pdf> (page 7)

#### 70657: NINJAGO City Docks

2018's [NINJAGO City Docks set](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/ninjago-city-docks-70657) seems to have no relation to Junkbot initially, however there is an entire Junkbot-themed arcade cabinet hidden inside the blue arcade room.

This is just an arcade cabinet with Junkbot's colours and some stickers, but it's great to see the memory living on 17 years later. Here's how it looks:

|                                                Hand-held[^ninjago-1]                                                 |                                               In context[^ninjago-2]                                                | All arcade machines[^ninjago-3]                                                                          |

#### 10273: Haunted House

2020's [Haunted House set](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/haunted-house-10273) is even further detached from Junkbot, and far more subtle!

|                                           Minifigure [^hauntedhouse-1]                                            |                                     In disguise as a "box of junk" [^hauntedhouse-1]                                     |

### Play Junkbot online

Whilst Junkbot's game files can be downloaded from LEGO's site directly via archive.org[^can-be-downloaded], the game has also been recreated in more modern software (HTML / JavaScript), making it playable in a browser!

[![play LEGO Junkbot online](/assets/images/2024/junkbot-html5.png)](https://1j01.github.io/janitorial-android/#junkbot)

[1j01's "Janitorial Android"](https://1j01.github.io/janitorial-android/#junkbot) has clearly had extreme amounts of care put into it, and made a (controversially!) better game than the original. It contains all original functionality, plus lots of new extras. So, what's changed? Well, here's what I noticed:

1. A complete custom level creator has been added[^custom-level-creator], as well as the ability to export & import.
2. All levels in all 4 buildings are unlocked from the start, instead of further buildings requiring level completion.
3. Zooming in and out with mouse wheel (or `+` / `-`).
4. Minor changes to the sound effects (e.g. no music)[^html5-sound-effects].

There are tens of additional ideas on the [project's GitHub page](https://github.com/1j01/janitorial-android?tab=readme-ov-file#various-ideas) if you're interested in contributing. The impressive project is based on [rozniak's earlier C# rebuild](https://github.com/rozniak/Junkbot), but has realistically replaced it.
