In 2003, the internet was a lot more innocent. People happily clicked suspicious looking links, browsers trusted websites implicitly, and instead of malware we had pranks and time-wasters. "Most Annoying Webpage" was one of these, taking a few precious minutes out of any victim's day. 

## What was it?

The "Most Annoying Webpage" realistically wasn't *that* annoying. It queued up 150 dialogs, forcing the user to click "OK" on each one individually. Due to browsers being a bit too trusting of websites in the early internet, there was no way to change tab, dismiss all remaining alerts or any similar workaround. Additionally, as many users weren't expert computer users, many manually clicked the "OK" button.

You can view an [archived version of the site here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030402051520/http://www.mostannoyingwebpage.com/v1/) and click "Yes, I'm Sure" to begin displaying the alerts. On any modern browser they won't cause any issues, and can be dismissed by just changing tab. 

Once a victim makes their way through all the alerts, they are prompted to send their friends a link via "TAF Master", an advertising link manager (similar to adf.ly today). Considering this link was active throughout the site's lifetime, it's likely advertising revenue was the main goal of the developer. The preticked boxes for the referral form[^referral-form] give a good indicator of how much spam you'd likely receive!
