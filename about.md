Internet History is a series of deep dives into internet history by [Jake Lee](https://jakelee.co.uk/about/), with extra technical analysis providing a unique take on well-known events or media. Extra attention will be paid to independently verifying dates and facts where possible, and referencing all claims, in contrast to most contemporary articles about internet history.

Articles will usually be published on the anniversary of an event / media release, if you've enjoyed an article all tips are appreciated!
