Welcome to this site!
hope you enjoy it.
keep pushing ok to continue onto your surprise.
so, while were waiting, how are you?
hope youre fine.
im fine too, thanks for asking.
but you didnt ask, did you?
you dont even care how i am, do you?
you think this page just created itself, dont you?
little do you know, a real person made this page.
someone with hopes, dreams, a life.
but you dont care.
youre such a rude person!
since youre so rude, maybe i should toy with you for a while.
becuase as long as these little boxes keep popping up, youre stuck.
go ahead and try.
stop doesnt work, does it?
nothing works. your stuck!
hahaha!
what if this stuff keeps going on forever?
alert after alert after alert....
as far as you know, they do keep going.
so, i guess were stuck together for a while.
while were waiting, why dont we have a talk.
you know, a heart to heart.
(DYNAMIC)so, whats your name, anyways?
(DYNAMIC)nice to meet you, _ thanks for coming to the site.
you have a weird name!
you must get teased a lot.
what kind of person would name their kid your name?
not my parents.
maybe yours, but not mine.
I mean, just look at your name!
gosh, were they drunk or something?
Just kidding, its not that bad.
yeah yeah, i know what your thinking...
I have things to do!
People to see!
or is it the other way around? heh heh.
But this is actually pretty fun.
for me it is.
Are you mad at me though?
This is actually pretty irritating.
But dont blame me.
blame whoever sent you this link.
theyre the ones who want you to go through this torture.
this is torture, isnt it?
I bet your finger is getting tired.
you have to keep clicking and clicking...
and clicking and clicking......
hope you dont get carpal tunnel syndrome.
dont sue me if you do.
ill just deny it.
you could just hit spacebar if you want.
it works just the same.
so, what should we talk about now?
(DYNAMIC)make a suggestion:
(DYNAMIC)  _??!!!???! what a dumb thing to talk about!
are you stoned are something?
i mean wake up, ive heard of dumb things but jeez.....
no, just kidding, that wasnt THAT bad...
its just that its kind of a boring subject.
soOoOo...
i guess youre getting pretty tired.
youve been here for a while.
so far, its been 65 alerts youve gone through.
65! can you believe it?
you know what my favorite number is?
guess.
nope, guess again.
my favorite number is 150.
dont you think thats a nice, big number?
why dont we try to get up to that number?
dont you think that would be fun?
we could go alert after alert after alert....
150! that would be the coolest!
then you could tell all your friends..
i went to this fun page,
and we had to get through 150 alerts to get in!
but once i got in there,
it was the coolest place in the world.
because theres a surprise at the end, you know.
a really, really, really cool surprise.
cool cool cool.
cool times a trillion.
but to get there, you have to get through 150 alerts.
should we try?
lets try.
this is number 89, by the way.
90.....
91.....
92.....
93.....
94.....
95.....
you know whats cool about this alert thing?
you have to listen to every thing i say.
and you have to agree with it
because every time you push ok, you agree.
like, if i say -you suck!!- you agree with me.
because you pushed ok, you agreed!
you stink!
agreed with that too, didnt you?
haha, this is soooo fun!
were on number 105, by the way.
45 to go!
you know, if i were you..
i would get really mad at whoever told me to go here.
i mean, they are totally wasting your time!
but you know, now its your turn
to send this adress to people you know. 
now you can waste other peoples time
like i wasted yours.
so, just send this adress to your so called friends,
and perpetuate this little torture device.
this is alert #115, by the way.
you know what?
im running out of things to say.
maybe i should type one word at a time now.
this
game
is
annoying
you
isnt
it?
by
the
way,
this
alert
is
number
133
so, seeing as how we only have 16 more alerts to go,
i guess i should start saying my goodbyes.
its been a long hard trip for both of us,
and i know its been an annoying one for you.
you are probably getting really mad,
maybe you are fuming with anger.
i bet you are going crazy.
but you know, theres a lesson to be learned of this.
always ask how someone is
when you first meet them.
it would be a better world for everyone
if we all were a little more civil.
so, goodbye, sayonara and adios,
peace out my friend.
and be proud
that you made it through 150 alerts.
this is number 150, so i guess its my last one. i hope you had fun reading these, and i hope you pass this page along to your friends! bye!
